SMU Web Application Development II Project

Module Overview: Web Application Development (IS216) is a course to help students learn the knowledge and skills to develop well-styled and responsive web applications that provide rich user experiences. The students will be equipped at the end of the course with full stack web development skills, who can build both front-end and back-end software. 

Project Overview: Built a dynamic and interactive one-stop cooking web portal "Half-Cooked", to primarily assist the young, health-conscious and inexperienced home cooks in learning and/or perfecting recipes, in an interactive and visually-appealing manner, with a large collection of recipes from different cuisines. The application is also developed with a back-end implementation for data storage and user authentication.
